# iTask-Todo List App

A simple and intuitive Todo List application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, JSX, and Vite. This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as finished or unfinished, edit, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in the local storage, ensuring they persist even after the browser is closed.
